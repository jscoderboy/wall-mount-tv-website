          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>Our website address is:
            http://tvmountexpress.online.
          </p>
          <h2>Comments</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>When visitors leave comments on the
            site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
            visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam
            detection. An anonymized string created from your email address
            (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see
            if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is
            available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of
            your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the
            context of your comment.
          </p>
          <h2>Media</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>If you upload images to the
            website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location
            data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and
            extract any location data from images on the website.
          </p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>If you leave a comment on our site
            you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
            cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to
            fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These
            cookies will last for one year.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to
            determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no
            personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your
            login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies
            last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If
            you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If
            you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be
            saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and
            simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It
            expires after 1 day.
          </p>
          <h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>Articles on this site may include
            embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
            content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the
            visitor has visited the other website.
          </p>
          <p>
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
            additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with
            that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
            embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
            website.
          </p>
          <h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>If you request a password reset,
            your IP address will be included in the reset email.
          </p>
          <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>If you leave a comment, the comment
            and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
            recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead
            of holding them in a moderation queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
            personal information they provide in their user profile. All users
            can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time
            (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators
            can also see and edit that information.
          </p>
          <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>If you have an account on this
            site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported
            file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you
            have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal
            data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are
            obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
          </p>
          <h2>Where your data is sent</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Suggested text: </strong>Visitor comments may be checked
            through an automated spam detection service.
